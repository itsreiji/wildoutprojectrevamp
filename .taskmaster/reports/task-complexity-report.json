		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Foundation and Tooling",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Vite + TypeScript setup and configuration. 2. ESLint + Prettier configuration for code quality. 3. Tailwind CSS installation and base theme configuration. 4. Validating that all build, development, and lint commands work together correctly.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational greenfield task involving the configuration of multiple distinct development tools. While individually straightforward, ensuring seamless integration between Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind introduces moderate complexity. It is configuration-heavy and must be done correctly to prevent future issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Models and ContentContext State Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Defining all TypeScript interfaces for data models (Event, Partner, etc.). 2. Creating mock data files for initial state seeding. 3. Implementing the ContentProvider, useContent hook, and state update functions.",
			"reasoning": "This is a critical architectural task creating the app's state backbone from scratch. The complexity lies in accurately defining numerous data models via TypeScript interfaces, creating comprehensive mock data, and correctly structuring the React Context provider and its update functions. Errors here will cascade through the entire app."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate shadcn/ui and Establish Global Design System",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Using the shadcn/ui CLI to install required base components (Button, Card, Dialog, etc.). 2. Configuring Tailwind CSS for glass morphism and other custom theme properties. 3. Integrating lucide-react and creating a reusable animation utility with Framer Motion.",
			"reasoning": "Based on the codebase analysis, this task is primarily about integration and configuration, not complex logic. Using the shadcn/ui CLI is straightforward. The complexity is low, with minor, self-contained challenges in setting up reusable animation patterns and custom Tailwind utilities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Core Landing Page Layout, Navigation, and Routing",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Setting up react-router-dom and defining the root layout route. 2. Building the responsive FloatingDock navigation component. 3. Building the Footer component and connecting it to the ContentContext. 4. Creating the main LandingPage container component to compose all sections.",
			"reasoning": "This greenfield task establishes the application's main shell. It involves setting up routing and building key layout components. The complexity is moderate due to the need for a robust, responsive layout, particularly for the sticky navigation dock which often requires careful CSS implementation to work across screen sizes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Event Showcase and Detail Modal",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Building the EventsSection component and fetching data from context. 2. Implementing the filtering UI and logic. 3. Creating the EventDetailModal component to display detailed event info. 4. Integrating the modal with the event grid using the shadcn/ui Dialog component.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires creating a new, interactive UI feature from scratch. Complexity comes from combining data fetching from the context, implementing client-side filtering logic, building a responsive grid, and managing the state for the event detail modal. It has multiple interacting parts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Remaining Landing Page Content Sections",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into 5 subtasks, one for each landing page section to be built: HeroSection (with animations), AboutSection, TeamSection, GallerySection (with lightbox), and PartnersSection.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating five separate, content-heavy components. The complexity score is high not because any single part is exceptionally difficult, but because of the sheer volume of UI development. Specific requirements like the gallery lightbox and animated hero stats add distinct technical challenges."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Admin Dashboard Layout and Protected Route",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Creating the DashboardLayout component with a responsive sidebar. 2. Implementing the ProtectedRoute component wrapper with placeholder authentication logic. 3. Updating the main Router to include the protected /admin route and its layout.",
			"reasoning": "This is a greenfield task to create the admin area's foundational structure. Complexity is moderate, stemming from the need to build a responsive dashboard layout (sidebar collapsing to a sheet) and implementing the protected route pattern, which is a critical piece of the application architecture."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Event Management (CRUD) in Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Building the event list view with a data table. 2. Implementing the 'Delete' functionality. 3. Creating the 'New Event' form using react-hook-form. 4. Creating the 'Edit Event' form view. 5. Integrating form submissions to update the global ContentContext.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it requires implementing a full CRUD interface from scratch. It involves integrating multiple libraries (data tables, react-hook-form), managing complex form state, implementing validation, and connecting all actions to the global state context. It sets the pattern for all subsequent CRUD tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Partner, Team, and Gallery Management (CRUD)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Building the Partner CRUD interface. 2. Building the Team/Artist CRUD interface. 3. Building the Gallery list/delete interface. 4. Implementing the Gallery image upload form and functionality.",
			"reasoning": "While this task follows the CRUD pattern established in Task 8, its complexity remains high due to the volume of work (three separate modules). It is not a simple repetition, as each module has unique forms. The addition of file upload logic for the gallery introduces a significant and new technical challenge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Build Site Settings and Static Content Editors",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Building the Site Settings editor form. 2. Building the Hero Content editor form. 3. Building the About Content editor form. Ensure all forms correctly update the ContentContext.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating several new forms and dashboard components. The complexity is moderate because it reuses the form and state management patterns from previous tasks. The forms are simpler, targeting singleton data objects rather than items in a list, which reduces the logical complexity."
