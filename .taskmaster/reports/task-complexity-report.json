			"taskTitle": "State Management: Implement Global ContentContext",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of mutation functions for each major data entity. Create separate subtasks for implementing CRUD functions (create, update, delete) for Team, Partners, and Gallery within the ContentContext, following the pattern established for Events.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task as it establishes the primary data-fetching and state management layer for the entire application. It involves fetching and managing state for 7 distinct entities, handling loading/error states, and implementing numerous mutation functions. The complexity lies in orchestrating multiple asynchronous operations and ensuring data consistency between the client and the database after mutations."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Admin UI: Build Dashboard Layout and Navigation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate the React/TSX code for the subtasks. Provide the code for the main `DashboardLayout.tsx` using flexbox, a static `SideNav.tsx`, and a simple `Header.tsx`. Then, show the modifications needed to make the layout responsive, including the `useState` hook for the mobile menu toggle.",
			"reasoning": "This is a low-to-medium complexity task focused on UI layout and styling. The core dependencies, including the UI component library (Task 3) and client-side router (Task 5), are already complete, which significantly reduces the implementation risk. The main technical aspect is handling responsiveness (collapsible sidebar), which is a common and well-understood pattern."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Feature: Implement Event Management CRUD in Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this feature down into a full implementation plan. For the list view, show how to use a `shadcn/ui` Table. For the form, provide a `react-hook-form` setup integrated with `zod` for validation. For the create/update logic, detail the Supabase Storage upload process followed by the database insert/update, encapsulated within a `ContentContext` function.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the integration of multiple complex systems: advanced form management with validation, client-side routing for list/create/edit views, and asynchronous file uploads to Supabase Storage. The logic for handling file uploads and then associating the returned URLs with the database record is a significant challenge that requires robust state synchronization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Feature: Implement CMS for Team, Partners, and Gallery",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate a plan that reuses patterns from Task 7. For subtask 1, define the new functions to be added to `ContentContext`. For subtasks 2, 3, and 4, outline the component structure and specify which components (Table, Card, Form) can be reused or adapted for each CMS section.",
			"reasoning": "This task's complexity is medium-to-high, primarily due to the volume of work required to implement three separate CRUD modules. However, its complexity is significantly reduced by its dependency on Task 7, which should establish all the necessary patterns for forms, data tables, and file uploads. The effort is in adaptation rather than novel problem-solving."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Public UI: Implement Public-Facing Landing Page",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate the skeleton code for `LandingPage.tsx`, showing how it uses the `useContent` hook and passes data to placeholder section components (e.g., `<HeroSection />`, `<FeaturedEventsSection />`). Also, provide an example of one of the section components, showing how it receives and renders the props.",
			"reasoning": "This task has low complexity as it primarily involves assembling UI components and wiring them up to the `ContentContext` data source. The core logic is straightforward data consumption and prop passing. The main effort lies in layout, styling, and ensuring responsiveness, which are UI-centric challenges rather than complex engineering problems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Public UI: Implement All-Events Page with Filtering and Search",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Provide a detailed implementation plan. Show the state management using `useState` for search query and filters. Write the core filtering logic using `useMemo` to create a derived list of events. Demonstrate how to implement pagination using `slice` and state for the current page.",
			"reasoning": "This task is of medium complexity. While data fetching is handled by the context, the core challenge lies in implementing the client-side state management for multiple filters, search queries, and sorting options. Correctly composing these filters and memoizing the result for performance requires careful state orchestration and is moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Backend Foundation: Rebuild Supabase Project from Scratch",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a detailed subtask breakdown. Create one subtask for project initialization. Create separate subtasks for each major table's SQL migration script. Dedicate a subtask to setting up the auth trigger for `profiles`. Create two separate subtasks for RLS: one for public-read policies and another for authenticated/admin write policies. Finally, create subtasks for Storage configuration and Edge Function setup.",
			"reasoning": "This is a maximum-complexity foundational task as it involves architecting and implementing the entire backend infrastructure. The complexity stems from the need for deep expertise in relational database design, advanced security implementation (Row-Level Security), authentication flows, and infrastructure-as-code practices. Errors in this task could lead to critical security vulnerabilities and major refactoring."
