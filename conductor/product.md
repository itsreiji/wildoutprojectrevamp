# Product Guide - WildOut!

## Initial Concept


## Vision
WildOut! is a dynamic, event-centric platform designed to provide an immersive experience for visitors while offering a robust, role-based management system for administrators. The core value lies in the seamless, real-time synchronization between the back-end data sources and the front-end presentation.

## Target Audience
- **Public Visitors:** Users seeking to explore events, view media galleries, and learn about the team and partners.
- **Admins/Editors:** Internal personnel responsible for content lifecycle management, including events, media, and site settings.
- **Developers:** Technical maintainers focused on system architecture, database integrity, and workflow automation.

## Core Features & Value Propositions
- **Real-time Content Synchronization:** Leveraging Supabase to ensure that administrative changes are reflected on the landing page immediately.
- **Advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** A dynamic permission system that controls access to specific admin sections and actions based on user roles.
- **Comprehensive Media Management:** Full CRUD capabilities for complex data types like Events, Gallery items, Team members, and Partners, including integrated image handling.

## User Experience (UX) Philosophy
- **Immersive Landing Page:** High-impact visuals and fluid animations to engage users.
- **Efficient Dashboard:** A productivity-focused interface for content creators.
- **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** Ensuring a seamless experience across all device types and for all users.

## Current Priorities (North Star)
- **Operational Reliability:** Hardening the synchronization layer and the RBAC implementation to ensure system stability.
- **Feature Completeness:** Finalizing all content management tools to provide a comprehensive administrative suite.

## Technical Goals & Constraints
- **Modernization:** Continuous refactoring to adhere to React 19 standards and Tailwind CSS 4 utility patterns.
- **Data Integrity:** Enhancing validation and error handling across Supabase and Inngest workflows to ensure a robust data pipeline.
