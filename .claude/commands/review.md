Perform a comprehensive code review of recent changes:

1. Check code follows our TypeScript and React conventions from CLAUDE.md
2. Verify proper error handling and loading states
3. Ensure accessibility standards are met (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
4. Review test coverage for new functionality
5. Check for security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, auth bypasses)
6. Validate performance implications (bundle size, render cycles)
7. Confirm documentation is updated

Provide specific, actionable feedback with file/line references.
